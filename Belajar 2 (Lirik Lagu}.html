    When your legs dont work like they used to before
    And I cant sweep you off of your feet
    Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
    Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
    
    And darling I will be loving you til were 70
    And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
    And Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
    Maybe just the touch of a hand
    Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
    I just wanna tell you I am
    
    So honey now
    Take me into your loving arms
    Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
    Place your head on my beating heart
    Im thinking out loud
    Maybe we found love right where we are
    
When my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds dont remember my name
When my hands dont play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul can never grow old, its evergreen
Baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
Im thinking bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe its all part of a plan
Ill just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that youll understand
    
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
Im thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are (maybe)
And we found love right where we are
